# LineUp
## "More than Tasks and Deadline"

The basic idea set behind LineUp is creating a helpful 'Productivity app' design, deeply concentrating userâ€™s attention on the tasks, deadline and providing incentives. There is a need to focus primarily to motivate and self discipline the users. LineUp comes up with an interesting and psychological solution by  implementation of Pomodoro Technique and Variable-Ratio reinforcement to increase user's productivity.
  
**Features of LineUp:**
 * Generic motivational quotes
 * Customizable Zen mode during working hours.
 * Timer clock on the lock screen. 
 * Formation of groups to share and keep a check on everyone's schedule.
 * A reward based competitive environment  
 * Receiving pop ups of current time at regular intervals.
 * Color coded calendar based on your everyday tasks.
